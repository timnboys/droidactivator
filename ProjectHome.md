## Piracy on Android is a nasty problem ##

Piracy in the Android world is is getting worse everyday. Recent surveys report piracy rates between 50% and 80%.

There are different reasons for this.

Installing an Android app is really easy. You can download an .apk and install it from any source. You can legally buy the app in the Market, make a backup, cancel the purchase within 15 minutes and restore the app. You can google "appname.apk" and get the links to your app in many sharing sites. You can root your device and gain access to every content.

Android's old "copy protection" is useless. The new Google's License Verification Library (LVL) is quite complicated to implement, misses some features and is tied to Android Market... furthermore, it is has already been defeated by some tools like AntiLVL... then what to do?

## DroidActivator's benefits ##

Copy protection can be implemented in different ways. No one is good for every app. It depends on many factors: application category, target, price, technology, and more.

DroidActivator has some unique features which may be useful if you need to:

  * license your app on a per-installation and per-device basis
  * sell one-shot or apply a regular renewal fee
  * apply a subscription model to sell features or contents
  * distribute and protect your app outside of AndroidMarket
  * manage promotions and gifts to single users
  * track custom events from your app

## The project ##

DroidActivator is a community Open Source project hosted on Google Code. The Android Library is licensed under LGPL and the Php backend is licensed under AGPL. You can link it to your proprietary commercial projects keeping your source code private.

DroidActivator is easy to set up and use. Take a look at the [QuickStart](http://code.google.com/p/droidactivator/wiki/QuickStartGuide) wiki and at [DroidActivator's Web Site](http://www.algos.it/droidactivator).
